# In short
- Used to mod NSMBW (code injection, level editing, etc)
- Now an actual student, learning stuff from people who know what they are doing
- Currently working on my C++, C#, Python, HTML/CSS/JS, SQL & more at university (soon enough PHP and some other things?), though also have some experience with PowerPC Assembly and Reverse-Engineering
- [French](https://github.com/giroletm/giroletm/blob/main/README-FR.md) ðŸ¤®ðŸ¥–
- Dreaming to become a full-time videogame developer, though that'll probably stay a dream
- Still modding whenever I have time, but not necessarely NSMBW
