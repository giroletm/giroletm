- Now an actual student, learning stuff from people who know what they are doing
- Currently learning C++ & HTML/CSS/JS at school (soon enough Java), though also have some experience with PowerPC Assembly and Python

- Dreaming to become a full-time videogame developer, though that'll probably stay a dream
